## Indicator feedback

This template is for providing feedback on indicators on ecRxiv. 
If you want to add a complete review of an indicator, use the *Indicator review - checklist* template instead.


Before you start:

- Replace "ADD ISSUE TITLE HERE" with a short title that explains what this issue is about. 
- Under **labels** in the right column, locate and choose the correct indicatorID from the list (if not already chosen).   

### Conflict of interest

- [ ] I confirm that I have conflict of interest that makes me unsuited to review this indiator. If not, I will convert this checkbox into an issue and declare my conflict there.

### Code of Conduct

- [ ] I confirm that I read and will adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecRxiv/blob/main/docs/code_of_conduct.md).
