<!--# This is a template for how to document the indicator analyses. Make sure also to not change the order, or modify, the headers, unless you really need to. This is because it easier to read if all the indicators are presented using the same layout. If there is one header where you don't have anything to write, just leave the header as is, and don't write anything below it. If you are providing code, Be careful to annotate and comment on every step in the analysis. Before starting it is recommended to fill in as much as you can in the metadata file. This file will populate the initial table in your output.-->

## 1. Introduction

<!--# Describe the indicator in general terms. It is a good idea to include a bullet point list of the spesific steps in the workflow -->
We aim to model the diversity of pollinators in Norway given their know interaction
with some plant species. From the estimated diversity across the nation, we intend
to look at the estimates in the ASO Data meadows by using their values as the reference
values. To achieve this, we do the following:

* a) obtain data from the Global Biodiversity Infrastructure Facility ([GBIF](www.gbif.org) ) for bumblebees, butterflies and bees.

* b) fit an integrated species distribution model (ISDM) to the data to obtain the distribution of pollinators

* c) obtain a web plot interaction matrix of the pollinator and plant species

* d) get data on the plant species within the interaction matrix from GBIF

* e) fit an ISDM data obtained in step (d) to estimate their respective species occurrence probability

* f) estimate the alpha diversity index of the pollinators across Norway using the results obtained in (b), (c) and (d).

![Flowchart of the modelling framework used in estimating the pollinator potential in this project. The modelling start with A) obtaining bees, bumblebees and hoverflies data from GBIF and fitting ISDMs to the pollinator data, then B) obtaining data on some selected plant species from GBIF and fitting ISDMs to the plant data, C) constructing the interraction between the plant and pollinators (from a given data) and D) estimating the alpha diversity indices. The covariate used to fit the ISDMs are presented in @tbl-covariate. The dataset and covariates are enclosed in dashed green-colored rectangular regions. ](../img/framework.png){#fig-framework}

## 2. About the underlying data

The pollinator [@pollinatordata] and plant species [@plantData] data used to fit the ISDMs were obtained from GBIF. The data was downloaded via the R-package **rgbif** [@rgbif], and extract the associated metadata using the same R-package. We downloaded GBIF data contains $26$ datasets and $30$ datasets with records on pollinators and plants respectively. We present a summary of the datasets downloaded for the pollinator and plant species respectively in @tbl-pollinatorMetaData and @tbl-plantMetaData respectively.

From the metadata, we ascertain the type of each dataset: either presence-only, presence-absence or count data. We merge all the presence-only data into one dataset (which we call `mergedDatasetPO`), but we do not merge the rest of the datasets. This is because the presence-absence data (procesed from sampling event protocols) have different sampling protocols, and we would like to preserve their unique attributes. A summary of the formatted dataset used to fit the ISDMs are presented in @tbl-pollinatorOcc and @tbl-plantSpsOcc.

```{r tbl-pollinatorOcc}
#| tbl-cap: 'Number of pollinator occurrences from the formatted datasets obtained from GBIF. All presence-only datasets are merged into one dataset (mergedDataset).'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

readr::read_csv("../data/pollinatorSummaryByDataset.csv")|>

```

### 2.1 Spatial and temporal resolution

Both pollinator and plant data obtained on a National scale (entire Norway) observed within $2010$ to $2024$. We present an illustration of the spatial distribution of the pollinator in the merged Presence-only and National insect monitoring in Norway datasets across the study region in @fig-pollinatorPOandNSOS.

![Distribution of bees, butterflies and hoverfies in the merged Presence-only and National insect monitoring in Norway datasets. The merged Presence-only dataset is colored by the taxon, and the National insect monitoring dataset is colored by the presence (1) or absence (0) value. ](../img/pollinatorPlots1.png){#fig-pollinatorPOandNSOS}

<!--# Describe the temporal and spatial resolution of the data used-->

```

**Iintend to keep either the table or the figures in the final document, depending on what is needed for the report.**

### 2.2 Original units

<!--# What are the original units for the most relevant  variables in the data-->

The original unit of the each dataset obtained from GBIF for the pollinators and plants are provided in @tbl-pollinatorMetaData and @tbl-plantMetaData respectively. The dataset are either presence-only and presence-absence.

For example, if the reference value has a regional resolution (varies between regions), it might mean that it is only valid and correct to use for scaling local variable values that are first aggregated to regional scale. However, sometimes the reference value is insensitive to this and can be used to scale variables at the local (e.g. plot) scale.  -->

## 7. Datasets

Here, we describe each of the dataset used for the modelling. We refer the readers to the dataset description provided on the [GBIF](www.gbif.org) website.  

```{r tbl-dataDescription}
#| tbl-cap: 'Datasets obtained on selected plant species from GBIF, the type of dataset, total number of occurrence records in each dataset and its percentage in the total number of occurrence records. The dataset with type sampling_event is treated as presence-absence, occurrence as presence-only and insectMonitoring as count data.'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
readxl::read_excel("../data/dataDescription.xlsx") %>%
  kbl()
```
*Here, intend to link all the datasets to their correct version on the GBIF repository.*


### 7.1 Pollinator datasets

<!--# Describe the main dataset, typicaly the one containing the variable of (most) interest. Change the header from Dataset A to the name of the actuall dataset. -->

```{r tbl-pollinatorMetaData}
#| tbl-cap: 'Datasets obtained on pollinators from GBIF, the type of dataset, total number of occurrence records in each dataset and its percentage in the total number of occurrence records. The dataset with type sampling_event is treated as presence-absence, occurrence as presence-only and insectMonitoring as count data.'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
readr::read_csv("../data/pollinatorMetaData.csv")|>
  kbl(col.names = c("Dataset name", "Data type", "No. of observations", "Percent")) 
```

Out of the 26 datasets obtained from GBIF, over half of the total occurrence reports for the pollinators were from the [Norwegian species Observation Service](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b124e1e0-4755-430f-9eab-894f25a9b59c), a third of the total occurrence report were from the [National insect monitoring in Norway](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/19fe96b0-0cf3-4a2e-90a5-7c1c19ac94ee), and the other 24 datasets cover 22 percent of the total pollinator occurrences.


<!--# Describe the unique datasets seperately under seperate headers (Dataset A, Dataset B, etc.-->

After processing the data, it is important that we filter only the bees from the following datasets: Solitary bees collected in a large-scale field experiment in power line clearings (southeast Norway), Bumble bees collected in a large-scale field experiment in power line clearings (southeast Norway), as can be seen in @fig-pollinator2 and @fig-pollinator3.

![Distribution of bees, butterflies and hoverfies NTNU university Museum collection and large scale field experiment in Norway. The observations are colored by the presence (1) or absence (0) value. ](../img/pollinatorPlots3.png){#fig-pollinator3}

We also filter out bees and butterflies datasets from the Bumblebees and butterflies in Norway dataset, displayed in @fig-pollinator4.

### 7.2. Plant datasets

From our query for datasets from GBIF, we got a total of 30 datasets which we used to fit the ISDM for the plants. Out of these occurrence records, about 86 percent of these records were from the [Norwegian species Observation Service](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b124e1e0-4755-430f-9eab-894f25a9b59c).

###  7.3. Covariates

We used several covariates to fit both the pollinator and plant ISDMs. The names of the covariates, their description and source are presented in @tbl-covariate. Additionally, we include the indication of whether the covariate is a habitat, trait or climatic variables as well as which of the ISDMs it was used to fit in @tbl-covariate. The rasters of the covariates are on $1$ km resolution.

```{r tbl-covariate}
#| tbl-cap: 'Description of covariates used to fit the integrated species distribution models and the source the covariates were retrieved from. The table indicated what type of covariate (habitat, trait and climatic) and which of the distributions it was used for (pollinator and/or plant) ISDM'
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
readxl::read_excel("../data/covariateDescription.xlsx")%>%
  kable()
```


We present the distribution of the covariates described in @tbl-covariate here in @fig-covariates.

![Covariates used to fit the ISDM. The resolution of the covariates are on a 1 km resolution.](../img/environmentalCovariates.png){#fig-covariates}

## 8. Spatial units

<!--# Describe the spatial units that you rely on in your analyses. Highlight the spatial units (the resolution) that the indicator values should be interpretted at. Potential spatial delineation data should eb introduced under 7.1. Datasets. We recomend using the SEEA EA terminology opf Basic Spatial Units (BSU), Ecosystem Asses (EA) and Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA). -->

## 9. Analyses

<!--# Use this header for documenting the analyses. Put code in seperate code chunks, and annotate the code in between using normal text (i.e. between the chunks, and try to avoid too many hashed out comments inside the code chunks). Add subheaders as needed. -->
We fitted an ISDM using the point process framework [REF] to the merged pollinator presence-only (PO) and presence-absence (PA) datasets. ISDMs are various observation models that are linked together by a shared ecological process. 

### 9.1. General overview of ISDMs

In this subsection, we present an overview of the ISDMs for general understanding of this document. For further details on ISDM, refer to @isaac2020data, @Dorazio2014 and @Fithian2015. The models are described using the point process framework as described in @peprah2023point. Additionally, we present the description of these models under the assumption that we are fitting a multi-species ISDM.

We model the presence-only data as a Poisson point process model [@illian2008statistical] with mean intensity $\lambda_i(s)$ for each species $i = 1, \ldots, S$, where $S$ is the number of species.This mean intensity modelled as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:int}
\ln(\lambda_i(s)) = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{ji} X_j(s) + \omega_i(s) + \eta(s),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{0i}$ is the species-specific intercept, $\beta_{ji}$ is the species-specific effect of covariate $j$, $X_j(s)$ is the $j^{th}$ covariate field, $\omega_i(s)$ is the species-specific spatial autocorrelation field and $\eta(s)$ is the bias field. $\omega_i(s)$  and $\eta(s)$ are modeled as zero mean Gaussian random field (i.e. $\omega_i(s) \sim N(0, \Sigma)$, where $\Sigma$ is a Mat'ern covariance matrix with variance $\sigma_{i}^2$ and range $\kappa_i$ and $\eta(s) \sim N(0, \Sigma_\eta)$, where $\Sigma_\eta$ is a Mat'ern covariance matrix with variance $\tau^2$ and range $\kappa_\eta$). 

We model the presence-absence data with a logistic regression model. Let $y_i(s)$ be a binary value at location $s$ with $0$ indicating absence of species $i$ and $1$ indicating presence of species $i$. Then $y_i(s) \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\Psi_i(s))$ with:
$$
cloglog(\Psi_i(s)) = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{ji} X_j(s) + \omega_i(s) 
$$
where the parameters $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\omega$ are defined in equation \ref{eq:int}.

All the ISDMs were fitted using the R-package PointedSDMs [@mostert2023pointedsdms].  

### 9.2. ISDM for pollinators

Using the model framework defined above, we fitted the ISDM to the pollinator dataset obtained from GBIF. Due to memory available, we fit the ISDM seperately for each pollinator.

# Add second bias field for PO data
model$addBias(datasetNames = 'mergedDatasetPO')
```

#### 9.2.1 Priors

We assume the following priors for the pollinator ISDM:

* The probability that the standard deviation of the pollinator spatial field is greater than $1$ is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\sigma_\omega > 0.1) = 0.1$).

* The probability that the standard deviation of the bias field is greater than $1$ is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\sigma_\eta > 0.1) = 0.1$)

* The probability that the spatial range of the pollinator spatial field is less than $15$km is $0.1$ (i.e $P(\kappa_\omega < 15) = 0.1$)

* The probability that the spatial range of the pollinator spatial field is less than $15$km is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\kappa_\eta < 15) = 0.1$)

* effects of continuous covariates (all covariates except land cover) and the intercept for each pollinator is assumed to be from a Normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance of $1$.

#### 9.2.2 Fit model and make predictions

We fit the model and make predictions of the pollinator intensity within the study region. We fit the model by using the adaptive strategy of the composite design integration strategy in `INLA` [@inla].

#### 9.2.3 Pollinator ISDM validation

We perform a five-fold cross validation to assess the trait effect on the pollinator distribution across the study region.


### 9.3. ISDM for plant species

Modelling all the $54$ species required memoey allocations we did not have, so we split the species into groups with $10$ species in each group. We fitted independent ISDMs for each of the groups.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

# PointedSDMs takes a longer time to fit for many species
# The trick to to break it into smaller groups
# The split will be done by the number of present speccies in each location
# I will split it nGroups time
sortedSpecies <- table(asoDatasf$acceptedScientificName)%>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Freq))%>%
  select(Var1)%>%
  c()

# Set the number of groups
nGroups <- 10

#split the species into groups of 10 species in each
plantSpeciesGroup <- split(sortedSpecies$Var1, 
                           seq(1, 
                               ceiling(length(sortedSpecies$Var1)/nGroups)))

```

Similar to the model the pollinator ISDM, we fitted an ISDM to the $54$ plant species. The ISDM has species-specific intercept, covariate effect and spatial field (but all the species share the same hyperparameters). We also added a spatial bias field to the observation model for the presence-only dataset. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false


speciesModelShared <- PointedSDMs::startSpecies(formatPlantData,
                                                Boundary = regionGeometry, 
                                   Projection = newCrs, 
                                   Mesh = meshForProject,
                                   responsePA = 'individualCount',
                                   speciesEnvironment = TRUE,
                                   speciesIntercept = TRUE,
                                   spatialCovariates = envCovsForPlantSpeciesModel, 
                                   speciesName = 'simpleScientificName',
                                   pointsIntercept = FALSE,
                                   pointsSpatial = NULL, # Do not include a dataset spatial field
                                   speciesSpatial = "replicate")  

# Add bias spatial field for the PO dataset
speciesModelShared$addBias(datasetNames = 'mergedPlantsPO')


```

#### 9.3.1 Priors
We assume the following priors for the pollinator ISDM:

* The probability that the standard deviation of the pollinator spatial field is greater than $0.1$ is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\sigma_\omega > 0.1) = 0.1$).

* The probability that the standard deviation of the bias field is greater than $0.1$ is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\sigma_\eta > 0.1) = 0.1$)

* The probability that the spatial range of the pollinator spatial field is greater than $50$ is $0.1$ (i.e $P(\kappa_\omega < 50) = 0.1$)

* The probability that the spatial range of the pollinator spatial field is greater than $50$ is $0.1$ (i.e. $P(\kappa_\eta < 50) = 0.1$)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

# hyper parameters of the spatial field (shared across species)
speciesModelShared$specifySpatial(Species = TRUE,  # define same prior for the all species
                     prior.sigma = c(1, 0.1),  
                     prior.range = c(5, 0.1))  


speciesModelShared$specifySpatial(Bias = TRUE, # Change the prior
                     prior.sigma = c(0.6, 0.1),
                     prior.range = c(5, 0.1))

# prior for random effects (mesh nodes of spatial field and species intercepts)
speciesModelShared$specifyRandom(
  # precision parameter on how much each species' spatial field (how much they can deviate from the shared ___)
  speciesGroup = list(model = "iid", 
                      hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "pc.prec",
                                               param = c(0.1, 0.1)))),  
  # precision parameter on the baseline species occurrence rate
  speciesIntercepts = list(prior = 'pc.prec',
                           param = c(0.1, 0.1)))  

```

#### 9.3.2 Model fitting and predictions

We fit the model by using the adaptive strategy of the composite design integration strategy in `INLA`. 
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

# specify the model options for INLA
modelOptions <- list(num.threads = 4,
                     control.inla = list(int.strategy = 'ccd', 
                                         diagonal = 0.001, 
                                         cmin = 0, 
                                         strategy = "adaptive",
                                         control.vb= list(enable = FALSE)), 
                     verbose = FALSE, 
                     safe = TRUE, 
                     inla.mode = "experimental")

# Species-specific spatial effects model
speciesSharedEst <- PointedSDMs::fitISDM(data = speciesModelShared, 
                            options = modelOptions)

# I proceed with the prediction of occupancy probabilities
# over the entire region
individualDatasetPreds <- predict(speciesSharedEst,
                                  data = ppxl,
                                  predictor = TRUE,
                                  n.samples = 500)
```


### 9.4 Species Interractions

```{r}
#| fig-cap: 'Webplot of plant species and pollinator interractions.'
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| label: webplot


  load("../data/webPlot.RData")
  #interractionMatrix <- readr::read_csv(paste0(dataFolder,"/interractionsData/interractionMatrix.csv"))
  
    bipartite::plotweb(WebReady[[1]])
```


### 9.5. Diversity Indices

To define the diversity of the pollinators, we estimate the pollinator intensity given their interaction with the plants species within the location $s$. This is estimated as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Intensity for intensity} &\propto \text{Estimated pollinator intensity} \times \text{Interraction weight} \times \text{plant species occurrence probability}\\
\implies \lambda^{\star}_i(s) &= \frac{\lambda_i(s) \times w_{ik} \times \Psi_k(s)}{\sum_k \lambda_i(s) \times w_k \times \Psi_k(s)}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $w_k$ is the weight of the interaction between pollinator $i$ and plant species $k$, $\Psi_k(s)$ is the occurrence probability of plant species $k$ and $\lambda_i(s)$ is the intensity of pollinator $i$.

We estimated the Hill's diversity indices for the pollinators. The Hill's diversity indices are defined as:
$$
H(s) = r_i(s) \times log(r_i(s));
$$
where $r_i(s) = \frac{\lambda^{\star}_i(s)}{\sum_{i} \lambda^{\star}_i(s)}$.

## 10. Results

<!--# Repeat the final results here. Typically this is a map or table of indicator values.-->

### 10.1. Distribution of pollinators accross Norway

We present the predictions of log-intensity of the pollinators in @fig-pollPreds and its standard error in @fig-pollPredsSD. The log-intensity for the three pollinators: bees, butterflies and hoverflies are similar with standard error close to $0$. This result can be seen as a direct consequence of the estimates of climatic and trait variables on the pollinator distribution (@fig-pollinatorModelFixedEffects and @fig-pollinatorModelLandCover).

![Standard error of the log-intensity of pollinators (bees, butterfliesand hoverflies) across the study region from the fitted integrated species distribution model.](../img/PollinatorPredictionsSD.png){#fig-pollPredsSD}

The effects of traits and climatic variables on the pollinator distribution in @fig-pollinatorModelFixedEffects. There is a negative latitudinal effect on bees and butterflies, but a positive effect on hoverflies. However, there is a positive effect of annual temperature on butterflies and bees, but a negative effect on hoverflies. There is an insignificant trait effects on the hoverflies distribution as their credible interval of these covariates includes $0$. The contrast of this statement is true for the bees and butterflies distribution.

In contrast to the trait and climatic variables, there seems to be ... (@fig-pollinatorModelLandCover).

<!--# Display the code (don't execute it) or the workflow for exporting the indicator values to file. Ideally the indicator values are exported as a georeferenced shape or raster file with indicators values, reference values and errors. You can also chose to export the raw (un-normalised or unscaled variable) as a seperate product. You should not save large sptaial output data on GitHub. You can use eval=FALSE to avoid code from being executed (example below - delete if not relevant) -->
